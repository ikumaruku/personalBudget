## Best Practices

- Ensure all amounts are numeric when sending data to the API.
- Use validation middleware to ensure robust input validation.
- Maintain unique IDs for envelopes to avoid duplication.
- Consider implementing persistent storage (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for better scalability.


## Future Enhancements

- Implement user authentication for secure access.
- Build a front-end application to interact with the API.
- Add reporting capabilities (e.g., spending analysis).
